    <h2>Frozen Before Freeze</h2>
    <p>
        Long before freezers existed, people were already obsessed with frozen treats. Around 200 BCE,           the Chinese were mixing milk, rice, and snow — arguably the first proto-ice cream.
        Meanwhile, Persians made something called faloodeh, a chilled dessert with vermicelli noodles,           syrup, and snow from nearby mountains. Talk about cool innovation.
    </p>
    <h2>A Royal Treat</h2>
    <p>
        Fast forward to the 1600s, and the Italians (particularly in Sicily) were blending ice with fruit juices and sugar — the birth of sorbetto (sorbet).
When this trend hit France through Catherine de’ Medici’s court connections, it became a symbol of wealth and class — only royals could afford the luxury of ice stored in underground ice houses. Now, Ice Cream and frezeers are everywhere!

    <h2>The American Treat</h2>
    <p>
        By the 1700s, ice cream had crossed the Atlantic. George Washington reportedly spent a small fortune on it one summer, and Thomas Jefferson even had his own recipe (vanilla, naturally).
Then came the Industrial Revolution, which made ice cream accessible to everyone — thanks to mechanical refrigeration and mass production, a far cry from the luxurious ice freezers in the century prior.
     <h2>The Birth of Modern Ice Cream</h2>
    <p> With the invention of the ice cream cone (popularized at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair) and freezers, ice cream went mainstream.
World War II soldiers even got ice cream as a morale booster — yes, it was military strategy.
    </p>
<p>
    So yeah. Ice cream began as literal ice cream, got expanded into luxury, before being taken to America and enjoyed by everyone, from Thomas Jefferson to the average joe putting their ice cream inside a bowl before the invention of the cone gave rise to the modern ice cream today.
